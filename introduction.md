# Introduction to micro:bit

## What is micro:bit

- A simple programmable device, originally developed by BBC maily for educational purposes. But it has properties that makes them good for purposes outside of the educational scope.
- It is somewhat similar to other devices like Raspberry Pi and Arduino, but micro:bit is more self-contained in the sense that it has a simple LED display, input buttons, various sensors (microphone, touch senseor, accelerometer and a compass) as well as a speaker built-in.
- It is running on a Nordic SoC (System on a Chip) that encompasses an ARM Cortex-M4 processor, a RAM, a Flash ROM and a radio component that enables communications such as Bluetooth.
- There are two versions of micro:bit with different hardware and development environment. We are only concerned with the newer V2 version in this course.
